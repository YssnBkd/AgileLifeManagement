# AgileLifeManagement Architecture Audit

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Branch:** architecture-audit-2025-05

## Overview

This directory contains the complete architecture audit of the AgileLifeManagement Android application. The audit was conducted following the framework outlined in `/docs/architecture/audit/README.md` and evaluates the codebase against the architectural principles defined in the project documentation.

## Directory Structure

- **`/metrics`**: Raw data collected during the audit process
- **`/findings`**: Specific architectural findings from automated checks
- **`/reports`**: Comprehensive analysis reports by architectural layer

## Key Reports

- [Architecture Audit Summary](reports/architecture_audit_summary.md) - Executive summary of all findings
- [UI Layer Audit](reports/ui_layer_audit.md) - Analysis of the presentation layer
- [Domain Layer Audit](reports/domain_layer_audit.md) - Evaluation of business logic implementation
- [Data Layer Audit](reports/data_layer_audit.md) - Assessment of data management components
- [Integration Audit](reports/integration_audit.md) - Cross-cutting concerns and layer interactions
- [Technical Debt Register](reports/technical_debt_register.md) - Prioritized list of issues to address

## How to Use These Reports

1. Start with the **Architecture Audit Summary** for a high-level overview
2. Review the **Technical Debt Register** to identify action items
3. Refer to layer-specific reports for detailed analysis of each component
4. Use findings as a reference during code reviews and refactoring efforts

## Next Steps

1. Review these reports with the development team
2. Create JIRA tickets for the high-priority items in the Technical Debt Register
3. Schedule follow-up audits to track progress (recommended quarterly)
4. Update architecture documentation based on findings

## Running Audit Scripts

The automated scripts used for this audit can be re-run to measure progress:

```bash
# Package structure analysis
find app/src -type f -name "*.kt" | grep -o "app/src/main/java/com/.*/agilelifemanagement/[^/]*" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > audit/metrics/package_stats.txt

# Component counts
find app/src -type f -name "*.kt" | xargs grep -l "class" | xargs grep -l "ViewModel" | wc -l > audit/metrics/viewmodel_count.txt
find app/src -type f -name "*.kt" | xargs grep -l "class" | xargs grep -l "Repository" | wc -l > audit/metrics/repository_count.txt
find app/src -type f -name "*.kt" | xargs grep -l "@Composable" | wc -l > audit/metrics/composable_count.txt

# Architecture violations check
grep -r "import com.example.agilelifemanagement.data" app/src/main/java/com/example/agilelifemanagement/ui --include="*.kt" > audit/findings/architecture_violations.txt
```
