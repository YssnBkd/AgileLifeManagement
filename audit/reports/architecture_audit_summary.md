# AgileLifeManagement Architecture Audit Report

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Branch:** architecture-audit-2025-05  
**Conducted by:** Cascade AI Assistant

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive architecture audit of the AgileLifeManagement Android application. The audit was conducted to evaluate compliance with Clean Architecture principles, identify potential architectural violations, and provide recommendations for improving code quality and maintainability.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Data Layer Files | 103 | Largest layer by file count |
| Domain Layer Files | 78 | |
| UI Layer Files | 73 | |
| DI Module Files | 10 | |
| ViewModels | 25 | |
| Repositories | 60 | Potential over-fragmentation |
| Composable Files | 49 | |

## Primary Findings

### Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture Compliance**: The codebase demonstrates strong adherence to Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between UI, domain, and data layers.
2. **Dependency Direction**: No instances were found of UI components directly importing data layer classes, indicating proper layering.
3. **Repository Pattern**: Repositories appear to be implementing interfaces properly, supporting testability and dependency inversion.
4. **Entity Definitions**: Database entities all have proper annotations.
5. **Dependency Injection**: ViewModels appear to be correctly annotated with @HiltViewModel, facilitating proper DI.
6. **Threading Practices**: No immediate evidence of main thread blocking operations.
7. **Security**: No use of SharedPreferences detected (likely using DataStore as recommended).

### Areas for Improvement

1. **StateFlow Usage**: One ViewModel (`TaskListScreenWithViewModel`) was found not using StateFlow for state management.
2. **Large Composables**: Several UI files exceed 500 lines, suggesting potential for refactoring:
   - `DayTemplateScreen.kt` (811 lines)
   - `DayDetailScreen.kt` (792 lines)
   - `SprintReviewScreen.kt` (774 lines)
   - `TaskListScreen.kt` (735 lines)
   - `SprintListScreenWithViewModel.kt` (704 lines)

3. **Repository Count**: With 60 repository files, there may be over-fragmentation or duplication of responsibilities.

## Recommendations

1. **UI Layer Refactoring**:
   - Break down large composables into smaller, reusable components
   - Standardize state management across ViewModels
   - Consider extracting preview composables to separate files

2. **Domain Layer Optimization**:
   - Review use case implementation for consistency in applying operator invoke pattern
   - Consider consolidating related use cases

3. **Data Layer Refinement**:
   - Review repository implementation for potential consolidation
   - Ensure consistent error handling across repositories

4. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Implement UI testing for large composable screens
   - Increase test coverage for the domain layer

## Next Steps

1. Create JIRA tickets for addressing the identified issues
2. Prioritize refactoring large composables
3. Standardize StateFlow usage across all ViewModels
4. Schedule quarterly architecture reviews
