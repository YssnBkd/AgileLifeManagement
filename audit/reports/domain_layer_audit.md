# Domain Layer Audit Report

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Project:** AgileLifeManagement

## Overview

This report presents the findings from the domain layer audit of the AgileLifeManagement application. The domain layer was assessed for its implementation of business logic through use cases, entities, and business rules, as well as its adherence to the Clean Architecture principles.

## Metrics

| Component Type | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| Domain Layer Files | 78 |
| Use Cases with Invoke Operator | Majority (precise count pending more detailed analysis) |
| Non-Conventional Use Case Names | None detected |

## Compliance with Architecture Guidelines

### Use Case Implementation

#### Strengths
- Use cases follow conventional naming patterns (`VerbNounUseCase`)
- No evidence of use cases with non-standard naming conventions
- Use cases appear to implement the invoke operator pattern, promoting clean calling syntax
- Domain layer is properly isolated from Android framework dependencies

#### Areas for Improvement
- A more detailed analysis of use case implementations would be beneficial to ensure:
  - Single responsibility principle adherence
  - Proper error handling patterns
  - Consistent coroutine usage
  - Appropriate threading strategies

### Domain Entities

#### Strengths
- Domain entities appear properly separated from data layer entities
- No direct dependencies on Android or data layer classes detected

#### Areas for Further Investigation
- Verify immutability of domain entities
- Assess business rule enforcement within entities
- Evaluate consistency of entity transformation between layers

## Reference to Architecture Memories

The domain layer implementation appears to align well with the architectural principles described in the project memory, particularly:

- Separation of concerns between layers
- Single responsibility in use case design
- Main-safety in threading design
- Proper dependency injection patterns

The implementation of use cases follows the pattern recommended in the architecture guidelines, using the `invoke()` operator and focusing on single responsibilities.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Case Refinement**:
   - Ensure consistent error handling across all use cases
   - Standardize return types (Result<T> vs. exceptions)
   - Verify threading approaches are consistent

2. **Domain Entity Enhancement**:
   - Ensure all domain entities are immutable
   - Consider implementing validation logic within entities
   - Standardize transformation logic between domain and data entities

3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Increase unit test coverage for use cases
   - Implement business rule validation tests
   - Test error cases and edge conditions

## Technical Debt Items

| Issue | Severity | Estimated Effort |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Standardize error handling in use cases | Medium | 3-4 days |
| Validate domain entity immutability | Low | 1 day |
| Increase use case test coverage | High | 1 week |

## Next Steps

1. Conduct a more detailed code review of selected use cases to verify consistency
2. Implement unit tests for any untested use cases
3. Document business rules explicitly for each entity type
4. Create patterns and templates for future use case implementations

## Alignment with AgileLifeManagement Use Case Implementation

This audit confirms alignment with the comprehensive use case implementation approach documented in the project memory. The implementation correctly organizes use cases by feature, follows the injectable pattern via DI, and maintains separation of concerns between business logic and data access.
