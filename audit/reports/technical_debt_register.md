# Technical Debt Register

**Date:** May 19, 2025  
**Project:** AgileLifeManagement

## Overview

This register catalogs technical debt items identified during the architecture audit of the AgileLifeManagement application. Items are categorized by architectural layer, assigned severity ratings, and include estimated remediation effort.

## Prioritization Criteria

- **Critical**: Must be addressed immediately - blocks development, causes crashes, or presents security risks
- **High**: Should be addressed in the next 1-2 sprints - impacts performance, scalability, or user experience
- **Medium**: Should be addressed within the next quarter - affects maintainability or code quality
- **Low**: Should be addressed when convenient - minor inconsistencies or improvements
