# Architecture Audit Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to auditing the AgileLifeManagement application's architecture. The audit is structured to systematically evaluate each layer of the application against established best practices and patterns defined in our architecture documentation.

## Audit Process

The architecture audit should be conducted in the following order:

1. **Project Structure Review**
2. **Architecture Layer Compliance**
3. **UI Layer Evaluation**
4. **Domain Layer Evaluation**
5. **Data Layer Evaluation**
6. **Integration Point Analysis**
7. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
8. **Testing Coverage Analysis**
9. **Performance Evaluation**
10. **Security Assessment**

### Tools
```bash
# Count files by package
find app/src -type f -name "*.kt" | grep -o "app/src/main/java/com/example/agilelifemanagement/[^/]*" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# List all dependencies
./gradlew app:dependencies > dependencies_report.txt
```
