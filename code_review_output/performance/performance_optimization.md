# Performance and Optimization Assessment

## Potential Performance Bottlenecks
- **Repository Layer:** Complex repositories (e.g., TaskRepositoryImpl) with many dependencies could become bottlenecks if not modularized. Monitor and refactor as logic grows.
- **SyncManager:** Handles background synchronization and retry logic. Ensure it does not block the UI thread and uses appropriate coroutine dispatchers (IO or Default).

## Memory Management
- **Compose:** Use stateless composables and avoid keeping large objects in memory within UI state. Prefer `remember` only for necessary state, and use `LaunchedEffect` for side effects.
- **Database:** Room is used for local storage. Use `Flow` for observing data and avoid loading large datasets into memory at once. Paginate where possible.
- **Resource Usage:** Centralized theme, color, and dimension resources help prevent duplication and memory waste.

## Startup Time Optimization
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt modules are well-organized; avoid heavy initialization in `Application` or DI modules. Defer heavy operations to background threads after launch.
- **Lazy Initialization:** Use lazy or on-demand initialization for non-critical dependencies.

## UI Rendering Performance
- **Compose Best Practices:**
  - Use keys in lists (e.g., LazyColumn) to optimize recomposition.
  - Minimize recomposition scope by splitting large composables.
  - Use `derivedStateOf` and `snapshotFlow` for expensive calculations.
- **Animation:** Use the centralized animation constants for consistent and performant transitions.

## Background Processing
- **Coroutines:** Use IO dispatcher for database/network work. Use Default for CPU-bound work. Avoid blocking calls on Main.
- **SyncManager:** Implements retry and network monitoring for robust background sync.

## Database Query Optimization
- Use indexed queries and avoid N+1 queries in Room and Supabase.
- Profile queries for slow operations and optimize with proper indices.

## Recommendations
- Profile app with Android Studio Profiler for memory leaks and slow frames.
- Monitor Compose recompositions for unnecessary UI updates.
- Implement pagination for large lists.
- Ensure background sync and heavy operations never block the main thread.
- Regularly review Room and Supabase queries for efficiency.
