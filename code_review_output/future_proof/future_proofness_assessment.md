# Future-Proofness Assessment

## Scalability of Architecture
- **Feature Modularity:** The codebase is organized by feature and layer (data, domain, ui), which supports scaling as new features are added.
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data sources, making it easy to swap or extend storage and API layers.
- **Use Cases:** Encapsulate business logic and are easily testable and extensible.

## Maintainability & Readability
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has clear responsibilities, aiding maintainability.
- **DI with Hilt:** Reduces boilerplate and makes dependency management clean and scalable.
- **Kotlin Idioms:** Use of extension functions, data classes, and coroutines increases readability and reduces boilerplate.

## Dependency Management
- **Gradle:** Dependencies are managed centrally and grouped by concern. Regularly update libraries to avoid security and compatibility issues.
- **Version Pinning:** Pin library versions to avoid breakage from upstream changes.

## Compatibility with Latest Android Versions
- **Jetpack Compose:** Modern UI toolkit, fully compatible with latest Android APIs.
- **Material 3 Theme:** Supports dynamic color and system UI theming for Android 12+.
- **Room & DataStore:** Officially supported and regularly updated.
- **Navigation Component:** Aligns with latest navigation paradigms.

## Alignment with Google Recommendations
- **Architecture:** Follows Clean Architecture and MVVM, as recommended.
- **Testing:** Structure supports unit/integration/UI testing best practices.
- **Security:** Uses DataStore, encrypted storage, and avoids hardcoded secrets.

## Recommendations
- Continue modularizing by feature as the app grows.
- Regularly update dependencies and test on new Android versions.
- Integrate static code analysis (e.g., Detekt, ktlint) into CI.
- Document architectural decisions and update onboarding docs for new contributors.
- Monitor for breaking changes in AndroidX, Compose, and other Jetpack libraries.
