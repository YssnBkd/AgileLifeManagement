# Architecture Analysis

## Architectural Patterns

**Clean Architecture** is used, with a clear separation between:
- **Data layer** (`data/`): Handles local/remote data sources, repositories, mappers.
- **Domain layer** (`domain/`): Contains models, repository interfaces, and use cases (e.g., `CreateTaskUseCase`).
- **UI layer** (`ui/`): Composables, screens, navigation, and theming.
- **DI layer** (`di/`): Hilt modules for dependency injection.

The **MVVM** pattern is followed in the UI layer, with ViewModels (not shown in the sample, but inferred from structure) mediating between use cases and UI.

---

## Separation of Concerns
- **Use Cases** encapsulate business logic (e.g., validation and orchestration in `CreateTaskUseCase`).
- **Repositories** abstract data access (see `RepositoryModule.kt`).
- **Screens** are focused on UI rendering and navigation (see `TasksScreen.kt`).
- **Navigation** is managed via a central `AppNavHost.kt` using Jetpack Compose Navigation.

---

## Dependency Injection
- **Hilt** is used for DI, with separate modules for app-wide, database, repository, and use case dependencies.
- DI setup is clean, with singletons and appropriate scoping.
- Custom dispatchers are provided for coroutine context separation.

---

## Navigation Patterns
- **Jetpack Compose Navigation** is used, with a central `AppNavHost` and route abstraction via `NavRoutes`.
- Navigation flows are clear, with argument passing for detail screens (e.g., `taskId`, `goalId`).
- Bottom navigation is implemented via a dedicated component.

---

## Strengths
- Modern, scalable architecture aligned with Google recommendations.
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities.
- Testable, maintainable structure.

## Opportunities
- Consider further modularization by feature for even better scalability.
- Ensure ViewModels and UI state management are as granular as possible for complex screens.

**Next:** Code quality assessment, then performance, integration, security, testing, and future-proofness.
