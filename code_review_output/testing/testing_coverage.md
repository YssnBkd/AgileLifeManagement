# Testing Coverage Review

## Unit Testing
- **Unit Test Directory:** Present at `app/src/test/java/` (see `ExampleUnitTest.kt`).
- **Test Structure:** Example test is a basic placeholder. More comprehensive unit tests for use cases, repositories, and utility classes are recommended.
- **ViewModel/Use Case Testing:** Ensure all ViewModels and use cases have dedicated unit tests covering business logic, validation, and error handling.

## Integration Testing
- **Integration Points:** No explicit integration tests found in sample. Recommend tests for repository integration (local/remote sync), API error propagation, and synchronization logic.

## UI Testing
- **Instrumented Test Directory:** Present at `app/src/androidTest/java/`.
- **Compose UI Tests:** Add Compose UI tests for screens and key user flows (task creation, navigation, sync feedback).

## Test Quality & Maintainability
- **Test Readability:** Use descriptive test names and structure tests by feature/use case.
- **Mocking:** Use libraries like MockK or Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit and integration tests.
- **Test Data Builders:** Use builders or factories for creating test data objects.

## Recommendations
- Increase unit test coverage for all use cases and repositories.
- Add integration tests for sync, offline/online transitions, and Supabase API failures.
- Add Compose UI tests for user-critical screens (tasks, sprints, goals, etc.).
- Integrate tests into CI pipeline for automated execution on PRs.
