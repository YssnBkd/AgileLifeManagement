# Error Fix Plan for Gradle Build Errors

## Overview
This document outlines a step-by-step plan to resolve the errors from the Gradle build log dated 2025-05-08. The errors include unresolved references, Kapt warnings, and compilation failures. Fixes prioritize root causes, such as missing imports, DI issues, and configuration mismatches, while adhering to your error handling strategy (e.g., using Result class), modularization, and security rules.

## Error Details and Fixes

### 1. Unresolved References in DailyCheckupRepositoryImpl.kt
- **Errors:** Unresolved references to 'PendingOperation' (lines 70, 85, 96) and 'DailyCheckupDto' (line 110).
- **Likely Cause:** Missing imports, undefined classes, or synchronization issues with Supabase integration (from MEMORY[16eac2f7-5671-4a33-ac4d-2962443aad7b]).
- **Fix Steps:**
  - Add import statements (e.g., `import com.example.agilelifemanagement.data.model.PendingOperation`) if the classes exist; if not, create stub classes or DTOs in appropriate modules.
  - Ensure 'PendingOperation' is defined in SyncManager or related files; implement if missing, following the synchronization strategy.
  - Use Result class for error handling in repository methods to manage potential failures.
  - **Rationale:** Resolves compilation errors and supports modularization by clarifying dependencies.

### 2. Unresolved References in SprintReviewRepositoryImpl.kt
- **Errors:** Unresolved references to 'SyncManager' (line 25), 'getCurrentUserId' (line 50), 'scheduleSync' (lines 61, 75), and 'markSynced' (line 103).
- **Likely Cause:** Missing imports or undefined methods in SyncManager, possibly due to incomplete synchronization implementation.
- **Fix Steps:**
  - Add import for 'SyncManager' and ensure it's injected via DI.
  - Implement or verify methods like 'getCurrentUserId', 'scheduleSync', and 'markSynced' in SyncManager, using your Supabase integration for user ID retrieval and sync logic.
  - Wrap method calls in try-catch with Result class for better error handling and logging.
  - **Rationale:** Addresses root causes in data synchronization, enhancing reliability as per your error handling and modularization strategies.

### 3. Errors in RepositoryModule.kt
- **Errors:** Unresolved references to 'CheckupEntryDao' and 'CheckupEntryApiService' (lines 100, 101); no parameter found for 'checkupEntryDao' and 'checkupEntryApiService' (lines 108, 109); similar for 'ReviewEntryDao'.
- **Likely Cause:** Missing DI components or parameter mismatches in Hilt/Koin configuration.
- **Fix Steps:**
  - Define and provide 'CheckupEntryDao' and 'CheckupEntryApiService' in the DI module, ensuring they are scoped correctly (e.g., using @Singleton).
  - Correct parameter names or add them to the module functions; ensure all repositories are properly bound.
  - Verify that DAOs and services exist in their respective packages and implement any missing ones with error handling using Result class.
  - **Rationale:** Improves modularization and security by ensuring clean dependency injection, reducing runtime errors.


This plan should resolve all errors. Apply changes step-by-step and rerun the build to confirm. If additional issues arise, we can iterate using codebase search or file views.
