# Build Errors Analysis and Fix Plan

## Error Analysis

After running a Gradle build on the AgileLifeManagement project, the following errors were identified:

### 1. Coroutine Context Error in SprintRepositoryImpl

**File**: `/Users/yassineboulkaid/AndroidStudioProjects/AgileLifeManagement/app/src/main/java/com/example/agilelifemanagement/data/repository/SprintRepositoryImpl.kt`

**Error**: 
```
Suspend function 'suspend fun <T> withContext(context: CoroutineContext, block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> T): T' can only be called from a coroutine or another suspend function.
```

**Line**: 102

**Priority**: HIGH - This is a fundamental coroutine usage error that will prevent the application from compiling.

**Root Cause**: Attempting to call a suspend function from a non-suspend context. The method containing this call needs to be marked as `suspend` or the code needs to be wrapped in a coroutine builder like `launch` or `async`.

### 2. Dependency Injection Type Mismatches in UseCaseModule

**File**: `/Users/yassineboulkaid/AndroidStudioProjects/AgileLifeManagement/app/src/main/java/com/example/agilelifemanagement/di/UseCaseModule.kt`

**Errors**:
```
Argument type mismatch: actual type is '<anonymous>', but 'TempNotificationRepository' was expected.
```

**Lines**: 92, 100

**Priority**: HIGH - These errors will prevent dependency injection from working properly, causing the application to crash at startup.

**Root Cause**: The module is providing an anonymous implementation when a specific implementation type is expected. This is likely due to a mismatch between the interface definition and how it's being implemented.

### 3. Parameter Issues in TemporaryRepositories

**File**: `/Users/yassineboulkaid/AndroidStudioProjects/AgileLifeManagement/app/src/main/java/com/example/agilelifemanagement/domain/repository/temporary/TemporaryRepositories.kt`

**Errors**:
```
No parameter with name 'isCompleted' found.
No value passed for parameter 'description'.
No value passed for parameter 'scheduledTime'.
```

**Line**: 70

**Priority**: MEDIUM - These errors indicate that a model class is being instantiated incorrectly, which will cause runtime errors when the code attempts to use these objects.

**Root Cause**: There seems to be a mismatch between the expected parameters for an object constructor and the actual parameters being passed. The code is using an old parameter name 'isCompleted' which likely has been replaced with something else (probably 'status'), and is also missing required parameters.

## Fix Plan

### 1. Fix SprintRepositoryImpl Coroutine Issue
- Examine the method at line 102
- Add `suspend` modifier to the method if appropriate
- If not appropriate, wrap the `withContext` call in a coroutine scope

### 2. Fix UseCaseModule Dependency Injection
- Identify the expected type for the dependencies at lines 92 and 100
- Make sure the provided implementation matches the expected type
- Update the provider methods to return the correct type

### 3. Fix TemporaryRepositories Parameter Issues
- Update line 70 to use the correct parameter names
- Add missing required parameters (description, scheduledTime)
- Remove the 'isCompleted' parameter or replace it with the correct parameter (likely 'status')

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with fixing the SprintRepositoryImpl issue as it's the most straightforward.
2. Then address the TemporaryRepositories parameter issues to understand what model classes are involved.
3. Finally, fix the UseCaseModule dependency injection, which might require understanding how the fixed models are used.

After implementing these fixes, we'll run another Gradle build to verify the fixes and identify any remaining issues.
