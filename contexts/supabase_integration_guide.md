# Supabase Integration Implementation Guide for AgileLifeManagement

## Introduction
This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to adding real-time synchronization, backend integration, and robust error handling to the AgileLifeManagement Android app using Supabase. It builds on the existing codebase, which includes a sync manager and local SQLite store, and adheres to Kotlin and Supabase best practices. The goal is to enable offline-first functionality with seamless online sync.

## Prerequisites
- A Supabase project set up with the provided schema (e.g., tables for users, goals, tasks, etc., with Row Level Security enabled).
- The `supabase-kt` library added to your Android project (e.g., version 2.0.0 or later in build.gradle).
- Familiarity with Kotlin, Coroutines, Flow, and Hilt for dependency injection.
- Ensure the app has network monitoring and a basic sync mechanism (as seen in `SyncManager.kt`).

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Set Up Supabase Client and Authentication
- **Objective:** Initialize the Supabase client and handle user authentication.
- **Steps:**
  1. In `RepositoryModule.kt`, use Hilt to provide a `SupabaseClient` instance. Inject it with your Supabase URL and anon key (store keys securely, e.g., using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences).
     - Example: Add a module that binds `SupabaseClient`.
  2. Enhance `SupabaseManager` to manage auth: Use `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` for login and listen for auth state changes with `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`.
  3. In repositories (e.g., `GoalRepositoryImpl`), wrap operations with auth checks to ensure only authenticated users can sync data.
- **Best Practices:** Use sealed classes for auth states (e.g., `AuthState.Authenticated`, `AuthState.Unauthenticated`) to manage UI and sync logic.

### 2. Implement Real-Time Synchronization
- **Objective:** Use Supabase Realtime for bi-directional sync with WebSockets.
- **Steps:**
  1. In `SyncManager.kt`, add Realtime subscriptions for key tables (e.g., "goals", "tasks", "sprints"). Handle events (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to update the local database.
     - Use `supabase.realtime.subscribe` and parse events to call DAO methods.
  2. Modify `syncPendingChanges` to process both local queues and incoming Realtime events. Add conflict resolution, e.g., compare `updated_at` timestamps and use last-write-wins.
  3. Handle network interruptions: Use `workmanager` for background sync and retry logic with exponential backoff.
- **Best Practices:** Leverage Kotlin Flows for reactive updates to the UI, ensuring real-time changes are propagated without blocking.
- **Challenges:** Manage WebSocket disconnections; implement reconnection logic in `SyncManager.init`.

### 3. Backend Integration with Storage and Edge Functions
- **Objective:** Sync data and files with Supabase backend, including Storage and custom logic via Edge Functions.
- **Steps:**
  1. For data sync, update sync methods in `SyncManager` (e.g., `syncGoal`) to use `supabase.from("goals").upsert(...)` or `update` with RLS filters.
  2. Integrate Supabase Storage: Add methods for file uploads/downloads with retry logic. Cache files locally and sync changes.
     - Example: In a new `StorageSyncManager`, use `supabase.storage.from("bucket").upload(...)`.
  3. Use Edge Functions for server-side validation, e.g., call `supabase.functions.invoke` to check for conflicts before syncing.
- **Best Practices:** Queue storage operations similarly to data sync and use Coroutines for asynchronous handling.
- **Challenges:** Handle large file transfers; implement progress indicators in the UI.

### 4. Error Handling and Conflict Resolution
- **Objective:** Ensure robust error management and resolve data conflicts.
- **Steps:**
  1. Use Kotlin `Result` types in all repository and sync methods to handle success and failure states.
  2. Implement conflict resolution in `handleRealtimeUpdate` or sync methods, e.g., compare versions or timestamps and log conflicts.
  3. Display user-friendly errors: In ViewModels, map errors to UI states (e.g., show toasts for network errors) and use sealed classes for error types.
- **Best Practices:** Add comprehensive logging and unit tests for sync logic. Use structured concurrency to avoid leaks.
- **Challenges:** Data conflicts in multi-device scenarios; start with simple strategies and iterate based on testing.

### 5. Code Structure and Modularization
- **Objective:** Maintain a clean architecture.
- **Steps:**
  1. Organize code into layers: Data (repositories, DAOs), Domain (use cases, models), UI (ViewModels).
  2. Create a dedicated `sync` package with classes like `RealtimeSubscriber.kt` and `SyncWorker.kt`.
  3. Update Hilt modules to inject Supabase components.
- **Best Practices:** Follow SOLID principles; add tests using mocked Supabase responses.

## Potential Challenges and Recommendations
- **Challenges:** Network reliability, battery usage from WebSockets, and complex conflict scenarios.
- **Recommendations:** Test with simulated network conditions, monitor performance, and consider user feedback for error messages. Always prioritize data integrity and security.

This guide should be adapted based on testing and specific app needs.
