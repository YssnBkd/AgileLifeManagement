# Screen Implementation Plan

## Key Screens Breakdown (Inferred from Use Cases)
- **Calendar Screen:** Central hub for planning, shows tasks/goals/sprints on a timeline.
- **Tasks Screen:** List, filter, and manage tasks; supports creation, editing, and completion.
- **Task Detail Screen:** Detailed view and editing of a single task, with dependencies, tags, and comments.
- **Goals Screen:** List and manage goals, track progress, and visualize goal completion.
- **Goal Detail Screen:** Detailed goal info, associated tasks, and progress tracking.
- **Sprints Screen:** List and manage sprints, show active/inactive, and sprint summaries.
- **Sprint Detail Screen:** Sprint backlog, progress, and review features.
- **Daily Checkup Screen:** Quick daily review, habit tracking, and notes.
- **Sprint Review Screen:** Rate and reflect on completed sprints.
- **Settings Screen:** Profile, theme, notification preferences, and integrations.

## Navigation Patterns & Information Architecture
- **Bottom Navigation:** For primary sections (Calendar, Tasks, Goals, Sprints, Settings)
- **NavHost:** Centralized navigation graph (see `AppNavHost.kt`).
- **Deep Linking:** Support for direct navigation to detail screens (e.g., via notifications).
- **Back Stack Management:** Use Compose Navigation's back stack for smooth flow.

## Data Visualization Components
- **Progress Bars:** For goals, sprints, and tasks (use Compose's `LinearProgressIndicator`).
- **Charts:** For analytics (consider libraries like MPAndroidChart or Compose equivalents).
- **Badges:** For notifications, overdue items, or achievements.

## Interaction Patterns & Feedback
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** For lists (use `SwipeRefresh` from Accompanist).
- **Snackbars:** For transient feedback (success, error, undo).
- **Dialogs:** For confirmations and critical actions.
- **Swipe Actions:** For quick task/goal completion or deletion.
- **Haptic Feedback:** For task completion or error states (use Compose's `HapticFeedback` API).

## Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support:** All screens must be fully accessible.
- **Focus Management:** Proper focus order and visible focus indicators.
- **Large Text Mode:** All screens should scale gracefully with system font size.

## Example: Navigation to Task Detail
```kotlin
composable(route = NavRoutes.TASKS) {
    TasksScreen(
        navigateToTaskDetail = { taskId ->
            navController.navigate(NavRoutes.taskDetail(taskId))
        }
    )
}
```
