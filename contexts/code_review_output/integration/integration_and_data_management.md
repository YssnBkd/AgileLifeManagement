# Integration and Data Management Assessment

## API Integration Patterns
- **Supabase Integration:** API services for User, Sprint, Goal, Task, and junction tables, with CRUD and specialized queries, follow a clean service abstraction.
- **SyncManager:** Coordinates data synchronization, tracks sync state, and handles automatic and retry sync, supporting offline-first strategy.
- **Error Handling:** Uses Kotlin's `Result` for propagating API and sync errors, with logging for debugging and analytics.

## Data Persistence Solutions
- **Room Database:** Used for offline-first local storage. DAOs and entities are well-structured.
- **DataStore:** Used for secure credential storage (see `SupabaseConfig`).
- **Repository Pattern:** Domain repositories abstract data sources, supporting local-first writes and background sync.

## State Management Approaches
- **ViewModel/StateHolder:** ViewModels (inferred from structure) manage UI state, using flows and immutable state for Compose screens.
- **Sealed Classes:** Recommended for representing UI states (loading, error, success) for exhaustive handling.

## Caching Strategies
- **Local-First:** Data is written to local DB first, then synced in background.
- **SyncStatusEntity/Dao:** Tracks sync status for robust offline support and retry.

## Recommendations
- Continue leveraging Room and DataStore for robust offline and secure storage.
- Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted and never logged.
- Use sealed classes for UI and sync state.
- Regularly audit API and sync error handling for consistency.
- Consider adding a repository interface for caching strategies if logic grows.
