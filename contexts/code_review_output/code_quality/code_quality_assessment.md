# Code Quality Assessment

## Kotlin Idioms & Language Features
- **Extension Functions:** Used for mapping (e.g., `toTaskDto`), which increases clarity and reusability.
- **Data Classes:** Used for models and DTOs, following Kotlin best practices.
- **Coroutines & Flows:** Used for async and reactive operations (see use cases and repositories).
- **Sealed Classes:** Consider using more for representing UI states and error types for exhaustive `when` handling.
- **Type Aliases:** Can be introduced for complex types to improve readability.

## Code Smells & Anti-Patterns
- **Repository Complexity:** Some repositories (e.g., `TaskRepositoryImpl`) accept many dependencies. Consider breaking down responsibilities or using helper classes for cross-ref logic.
- **Error Handling Consistency:** Error handling is generally good (using `Result`), but could be standardized further with sealed error types and global error mappers.
- **Mutable State:** Prefer immutable state in ViewModels and UI state holders; always use `copy` for data class updates.

## Error Handling & Edge Cases
- **Kotlin Result:** Used for propagating success/error, including in use cases like `CreateTaskUseCase`.
- **Validation:** Use cases perform input validation and return meaningful error messages.
- **Global Error Handling:** Consider a global error handler or sealed error hierarchy for uniformity.

## Concurrency & Thread Management
- **Coroutine Dispatchers:** Provided via DI (see `AppModule.kt`), separating IO, Main, and Default contexts.
- **Flows:** Used for async data streams and database observation.
- **SyncManager:** Handles background sync and retry logic for offline-first strategy.

## Resource Utilization
- **Strings, Dimensions, Colors:** Theme and color are centralized in the theme package. Ensure all UI text and dimensions are extracted to resources for localization and scaling.
- **Layouts:** Compose is used for screens, which is modern and efficient. Avoid deep nesting in composables for better performance.

## Recommendations
- Increase use of sealed classes for error and UI state.
- Standardize error handling using a common error contract.
- Further modularize repositories if they grow in complexity.
- Ensure all user-facing strings and dimensions are in resource files for localization and accessibility.
