# Calendar Feature UI/UX Plan

## Views
- **CalendarScreen:** Month, week, day views; overlays for events/tasks/goals
- **Event Dialogs:** Create/edit events, recurring event support
- **Sync Controls:** Toggle Google/Apple sync, view status, manual sync
- **Permissions:** Flows for calendar permission requests and consent

## UX Patterns
- Color-coded events by type/status
- Drag-and-drop for event rescheduling (if feasible)
- Pull-to-refresh for sync
- Snackbar/dialog feedback for sync/errors

## Accessibility

- Keyboard and screen reader support
