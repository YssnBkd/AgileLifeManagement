# Security Review

## Credential and Sensitive Data Handling
- **SupabaseConfig:** Credentials are stored using Android DataStore, following secure storage best practices.
- **Encryption:** Sensitive information is encrypted before storage, as per global user rules.
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** No evidence of hardcoded API keys or secrets in the codebase; all secrets are injected via DI or configuration.

## API Security
- **Supabase Integration:** API calls are made using secure endpoints. Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all network requests.
- **Token Management:** Tokens and session information should be stored securely and never logged.

## Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Use Case Validation:** Input validation is performed in use cases (e.g., `CreateTaskUseCase` checks for empty titles and valid references).
- **Global Validation:** Consider adding global input sanitization utilities for user-generated content (e.g., trimming, escaping, length checks).

## Data Encryption
- **Local Storage:** DataStore and Room are used for local storage. Ensure encryption is enabled for sensitive tables and preferences.
- **Network Communication:** All API traffic should be over HTTPS with certificate pinning if possible.

## Logging & Analytics
- **Sensitive Data Redaction:** Logging is implemented for debugging and analytics, but sensitive data is not logged. Continue to audit logs for compliance.

## Recommendations
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities (use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check).
- Periodically review DataStore and Room encryption settings.
- Add input sanitization utilities for all user input fields.
- Consider implementing security tests (unit and integration) to validate encryption, secure storage, and input validation.
- Review API client for up-to-date security best practices (e.g., certificate pinning).
