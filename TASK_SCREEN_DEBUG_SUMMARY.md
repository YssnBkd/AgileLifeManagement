# Task Screen Debug & Implementation Summary

## What We Did

### 1. Initial Setup
- Implemented the Task screen using Jetpack Compose, Hilt DI, and an offline-first repository pattern with Supabase integration.
- Used `TasksViewModel` with constructor injection and `@HiltViewModel` annotation.
- Set up navigation via `AppNavHost.kt` and screen UI in `TasksScreen.kt`.

### 2. Error Encounters & Fixes

#### **Error 1: Pinning Deprecated Warning**
- **Symptom:** Logcat warning about pinning being deprecated on Android Q+.
- **Action:** Determined to be non-blocking; no immediate fix required.

#### **Error 2: ViewModel NoSuchMethodException Crash**
- **Symptom:** Crash on Task screen access:
  - `Cannot create an instance of class TasksViewModel` (NoSuchMethodException)
- **Root Cause:**
  - ViewModel was being instantiated using the default Compose `viewModel()` instead of Hilt's `hiltViewModel()`.
  - `MainActivity` was missing `@AndroidEntryPoint` annotation.
  - Manifest did not register the Hilt-enabled Application class.
- **Fixes:**
  - Annotated `MainActivity` with `@AndroidEntryPoint`.
  - Registered `AgileLifeApplication` (annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`) in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
  - Removed manual ViewModel instantiation from `AppNavHost.kt` and let `TasksScreen` use `hiltViewModel()`.

#### **Error 3: Endless Loading State**
- **Symptom:** Task screen shows a loading indicator indefinitely.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The Flow from `taskRepository.getTasks()` never emits or is blocked upstream (repository/data source/network).
- **Debug Steps:**
  - Inspected `TasksViewModel` logic for state transitions.
  - Determined need to check repository, data source, and add logging for emissions and errors.

## What Remains To Be Done

- **Repository/DAO Debugging:**
  - Add logging to repository and DAO to confirm if `getTasks()` is called and emits data.
  - Ensure error handling in repository and ViewModel properly triggers UI error state.
  - Check if local DB or remote Supabase is initialized and accessible.
- **UI Improvements:**
  - Show a user-friendly error or empty state if no tasks are available or on error.
- **Sync & Data Flow:**
  - Verify SyncManager and offline-first logic are working as intended.
- **Testing:**
  - Add UI and ViewModel unit tests for loading, error, and success states.

## Open Issues

- Task screen stuck in loading due to missing or blocked data emission from repository/data source.
- Need to verify and debug the data layer, especially with the offline-first and Supabase sync strategy.

## [2025-05-09] Recent Improvements

### Repository & Data Layer
- Added comprehensive error handling and structured logging to `TaskRepositoryImpl`.
- All repository operations now log errors (with stack traces and context) and propagate exceptions appropriately.
- Insert, update, and delete operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks with logs, and rethrow errors for upstream handling.

### ViewModel
- Refined `TasksViewModel` to use a sealed `UiState` class with `Loading`, `Success`, `Empty`, and `Error` states.
- The ViewModel now emits `Empty` if there are no tasks, and `Error` if repository exceptions occur.
- Added a `retry()` function to allow the UI to re-trigger data loading after an error.

### UI
- Updated `TasksScreen.kt` to handle all `UiState` branches exhaustively.
- Added a user-friendly empty state with a message and "Add Task" button.
- Added a user-friendly error state with a retry button.
- Ensured the UI provides clear feedback for all loading, error, and empty scenarios.

**Next Steps:**
- Test the Task screen for all states (loading, empty, error, success).
- Optimize authentication feedback and loading timing for improved UX.
- Continue with planned improvements (sync feedback, advanced UI/UX, etc.).
