# Agile Life Management

A modern Android application that brings agile project management principles to personal life management. This app helps users organize their tasks, goals, and activities using sprints, daily check-ins, and retrospectives - just like in professional agile environments.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles with **MVVM** pattern:

- **Presentation Layer**: Jetpack Compose UI components and ViewModels
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic with use cases, models, and repository interfaces
- **Data Layer**: Repository implementations, local and remote data sources

Key architectural components:
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources from the business logic
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate business rules and operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Modular and testable components using Hilt
- **Reactive Data Flow**: UI updates reactively to data changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3 design
- **Architecture Components**: ViewModel, LiveData, Room
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Compose
- **Networking**: Ktor Client
- **Local Database**: Room
- **Backend Services**: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage)
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Kotlin Coroutines and Flow
- **Date/Time**: ThreeTenABP
- **Image Loading**: Coil
- **Logging**: Timber
- **JSON Serialization**: Gson
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## üìã Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 11
- Android SDK 35
- Supabase account and project

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgileLifeManagement.git
```

2. Configure Supabase credentials
   - Create a `local.properties` file in the project root if it doesn't exist
   - Add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
   ```

3. Open the project in Android Studio

4. Sync Gradle and build the project

5. Run on an emulator or physical device

## üîê Security Implementation
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure storage of credentials
- API security best practices
- Input validation and sanitization

## üíª CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated builds
- Static code analysis integration
- Automated testing on PR submissions
- Release automation and versioning strategy

<Future Proofness Guidelines>

# Future-Proofness Assessment

## Scalability of Architecture
- **Feature Modularity:** The codebase is organized by feature and layer (data, domain, ui), which supports scaling as new features are added.
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data sources, making it easy to swap or extend storage and API layers.
- **Use Cases:** Encapsulate business logic and are easily testable and extensible.

## Maintainability & Readability
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has clear responsibilities, aiding maintainability.
- **DI with Hilt:** Reduces boilerplate and makes dependency management clean and scalable.
- **Kotlin Idioms:** Use of extension functions, data classes, and coroutines increases readability and reduces boilerplate.

## Dependency Management
- **Gradle:** Dependencies are managed centrally and grouped by concern. Regularly update libraries to avoid security and compatibility issues.
- **Version Pinning:** Pin library versions to avoid breakage from upstream changes.

## Compatibility with Latest Android Versions
- **Jetpack Compose:** Modern UI toolkit, fully compatible with latest Android APIs.
- **Material 3 Theme:** Supports dynamic color and system UI theming for Android 12+.
- **Room & DataStore:** Officially supported and regularly updated.
- **Navigation Component:** Aligns with latest navigation paradigms.

## Alignment with Google Recommendations
- **Architecture:** Follows Clean Architecture and MVVM, as recommended.
- **Testing:** Structure supports unit/integration/UI testing best practices.
- **Security:** Uses DataStore, encrypted storage, and avoids hardcoded secrets.

## Recommendations
- Continue modularizing by feature as the app grows.
- Regularly update dependencies and test on new Android versions.
- Integrate static code analysis (e.g., Detekt, ktlint) into CI.
- Document architectural decisions and update onboarding docs for new contributors.
- Monitor for breaking changes in AndroidX, Compose, and other Jetpack libraries.
